# Player Head Drops V2 Data Pack for Minecraft 1.13

This data pack allows players to get other players heads by killing them.

This version is made for Minecraft 1.13 and it requires additional actions. You need to edit the contents of the data pack, specifically the loop function. In there there are examples of what you need to add in order to have heads of your server members.

Alternatively I included a Ruby Script that generates the loop function in a two ways.
- In game names as parameters separated by spaces: ruby phd_generator.rb IGN1 IGN2 IGN3 etc
- Drop your whitelist.json in the same folder as the script and run it without parameters.

Both will generate the loop.mcfunction file required to run this data pack. Each head generated with this script will have the texture information in it which makes the game render these heads faster.
